# **PKI** Public Key Infrastructure;


# **CSR** Certificate signing request
## reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request
- In public key infrastructure (PKI) systems, a certificate signing request (also CSR or certification request) is a message sent from an applicant to a registration authority of the public key infrastructure in order to apply for a digital identity certificate. It usually contains the public key for which the certificate should be issued, identifying information (such as a domain name) and integrity protection (e.g., a digital signature). The most common format for CSRs is the PKCS #10 specification; another is the Signed Public Key and Challenge SPKAC format generated by some web browsers.

- A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting your own SSL/TLS certificate. Generated on the same server you plan to install the certificate on, the CSR contains information (e.g. common name, organization, country) the Certificate Authority (CA) will use to create your certificate. It also contains the public key that will be included in your certificate and is signed with the corresponding private key. Weâ€™ll go into more details on the roles of these keys below.
