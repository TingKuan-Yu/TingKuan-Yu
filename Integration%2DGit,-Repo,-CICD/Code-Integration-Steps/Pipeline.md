- **What is a pipeline?**
A pipeline is a set of automated processes to reliably and efficiently compile, build and deliver code to production platforms. The reason for automation is to ensure that builds are performed in a consistent way on a reliable platform at regular intervals. Reducing manual intervention makes the process less prone to errors and improve quality. A pipeline can consist of several steps where the build is an individual task along with test, deploy etc.
For more detailed information around the structure of the pipelines please see Pipeline system structure.
